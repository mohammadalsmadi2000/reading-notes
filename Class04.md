# Classes, Objects, Recursion, and Pytest Fixtures Reading Notes
## Why this topic matters?
Understanding classes, objects, recursion, and testing with Pytest fixtures are essential for anyone interested in writing object-oriented programs in Python. Classes and objects are the foundation of object-oriented programming, and recursion is a powerful technique that can be used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems. Additionally, testing with Pytest fixtures is a crucial step in ensuring the quality and maintainability of Python code.

## Key differences between classes and objects in Python and how they are used to create and manage instances of a class.
In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class. A class is a user-defined data type that contains properties (variables) and methods (functions). Objects are created using the class constructor and can access the properties and methods defined in the class.

To create an object in Python, you first define a class using the class keyword, and then create an instance of the class using the class constructor, which is the name of the class followed by parentheses. For example, the following code creates an instance of a class named Person:
```
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

person1 = Person("John", 36)

```
In this example, we define a class Person with two properties name and age, and then create an instance of the class named person1 with the name "John" and age 36.

Objects are used to represent real-world entities in a program, and classes provide a way to organize related data and functions into a single unit. By creating multiple instances of a class, we can manage different objects in our program.

## Recursion and its implementation in Python
Recursion is a programming technique that involves solving a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems of the same type. In a recursive function, the function calls itself with a smaller input until it reaches a base case, where the problem is small enough to be solved directly.

Here is an example of a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number:
```
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

```
In this example, the function factorial() calls itself with a smaller input n-1 until n reaches 0, which is the base case. The function returns the product of n and the result of calling factorial(n-1).

When implementing a recursive function, it is important to define a base case to avoid an infinite loop. It is also recommended to keep the number of recursive calls as small as possible to avoid consuming too much memory.
