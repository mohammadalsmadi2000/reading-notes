# Page: Next.js - Dynamic Routes

## Why Dynamic Routes Matter

Dynamic routes in Next.js play a crucial role in creating dynamic and interactive web applications. As a developer, you want your application to respond differently based on the URL or query parameters. Dynamic routes enable you to handle variable data in the URL, allowing you to generate pages on the fly, fetch data from APIs, and create powerful user experiences. It matters in this module as it helps us understand how to build dynamic web applications efficiently using Next.js.

## Reading Questions

1. **Explain the concept of dynamic routes in Next.js and how they differ from static routes.**

   Dynamic routes in Next.js allow you to create pages with URLs that contain variable parts, denoted by brackets (e.g., [id]). When a user visits a dynamic route, Next.js automatically generates the corresponding page based on the variable data present in the URL. This data is accessible in the page component through the `context` object. Dynamic routes are beneficial when dealing with content that changes or when you want to display unique information for different items, such as blog posts, product pages, or user profiles.

   In contrast, static routes are predefined pages that do not depend on any data in the URL. They are suitable for content that remains constant and doesn't change often. When building a static page, Next.js generates the HTML at build time and serves that pre-rendered HTML to each user.

2. **Describe the process of deploying a Next.js application. What are the key steps involved, and what are some deployment platforms you can use?**

   The deployment process for a Next.js application involves several key steps:

   a. **Building the Application**: Before deploying, you need to build your Next.js application. This step generates optimized production-ready files that can be served to clients.

   b. **Choosing a Deployment Platform**: Next.js applications can be deployed to various platforms, such as Vercel, Netlify, AWS, or even traditional web servers. Vercel is the recommended platform as it offers seamless integration with Next.js and provides features like automatic deployments, serverless functions, and caching.

   c. **Configuring Deployment Settings**: Once you choose a deployment platform, you may need to configure some settings specific to that platform, such as environment variables or custom routing rules.

   d. **Deploying the Application**: After configuring the settings, you deploy the application to the chosen platform, which makes it accessible to users.

3. **How does Next.js handle static file serving? Discuss the default folder structure for storing static assets and explain how to reference them in a Next.js application.**

   Next.js handles static file serving through the "public" directory. By default, any files placed in the "public" directory are accessible by the Next.js server under the "/_next/static" endpoint.

   For example, if you have a file named "logo.png" in the "public" directory, you can access it in your Next.js application with the following URL: "/_next/static/logo.png".

   Next.js also allows you to use the `next/image` component to optimize images and provide features like lazy loading and image resizing on the fly. When using the `next/image` component, you need to provide the relative path to the image from the "public" directory, like this: `<Image src="/logo.png" alt="Logo" width={200} height={100} />`.
