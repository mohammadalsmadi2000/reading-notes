The purpose of dunder (double underscore) methods in Python is to define how objects of a class behave in specific situations. They are also known as magic methods or special methods. These methods are used to customize the behavior of built-in Python functions and operators, such as +, -, *, /, ==, !=. For example, the __len__() method is a commonly used dunder method that is used to define the length of an object.


The Python statistics module provides functions for calculating basic statistical properties of data. It includes functions for measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of variability (variance, standard deviation). One example of a function within the statistics module is mean(), which calculates the arithmetic mean of a list of numbers. For example:

```
import statistics

data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mean = statistics.mean(data)
print(mean)  # Output: 3

```

The mean() function calculates the average value of a list of numbers, which is a commonly used statistical operation.
