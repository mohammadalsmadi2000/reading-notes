The purpose of dunder (double underscore) methods in Python is to define how objects of a class behave in specific situations. They are also known as magic methods or special methods. These methods are used to customize the behavior of built-in Python functions and operators, such as +, -, *, /, ==, !=. For example, the __len__() method is a commonly used dunder method that is used to define the length of an object.

In the video "AI Guru makes $238,800 with misleading paid course," the main ethical issue raised was that the AI Guru used the work of developers without giving them proper credit or compensation. The developers had created a free open-source library, which the AI Guru used to create a paid course without attributing their work. To avoid this, the AI Guru could have contacted the developers and asked for permission to use their work or given them proper credit and compensation.

The Python statistics module provides functions for calculating basic statistical properties of data. It includes functions for measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of variability (variance, standard deviation). One example of a function within the statistics module is mean(), which calculates the arithmetic mean of a list of numbers. For example:

```
import statistics

data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mean = statistics.mean(data)
print(mean)  # Output: 3

```

The mean() function calculates the average value of a list of numbers, which is a commonly used statistical operation.
