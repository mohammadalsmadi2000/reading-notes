## Web Scraping

Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites by using automated tools or scripts. It allows us to retrieve structured information from web pages, which can be used for various purposes such as data analysis, research, or building applications.

### Why Web Scraping Matters

Web scraping is particularly relevant to today's study because it enables us to gather data from the vast amount of information available on the internet. As we explore different domains and topics, being able to extract relevant data from websites becomes crucial for conducting research, analyzing trends, and making informed decisions.

### Reading Questions

1. **What are the key differences between scraping static and dynamic websites?**

   The key differences between scraping static and dynamic websites are as follows:

   - **Static Websites:** Static websites are composed of HTML files that are delivered to the user's browser as-is. The content of the web page remains the same unless manually updated. In this case, web scraping involves parsing the HTML structure and extracting the desired data.

   - **Dynamic Websites:** Dynamic websites, on the other hand, use JavaScript or other scripting languages to update the content dynamically. The HTML structure of the page may change, and data may be loaded asynchronously. To scrape dynamic websites, tools like Playwright or Selenium can be used to interact with the website, execute JavaScript, and extract the updated data.

2. **Explain at least three techniques or best practices that can be employed to avoid getting blocked while scraping websites.**

   Some techniques and best practices to avoid getting blocked while scraping websites are:

   - **1. Respect website's terms of service:** Always review and follow the website's terms of service, robots.txt file, and any scraping guidelines provided. Adhering to these guidelines helps maintain a good relationship with the website owner.

   - **2. Use delays and timeouts:** Introduce delays and timeouts between requests to mimic human-like behavior. Sending too many requests too quickly can raise suspicion and result in IP blocking. Randomizing delays and timeouts adds an additional layer of unpredictability.

   - **3. Rotate user agents and IP addresses:** Vary your user agent headers to make requests appear as if they are coming from different browsers or devices. Additionally, consider using proxy servers or rotating IP addresses to avoid detection and prevent IP blocking.

3. **What is Playwright, and how does it assist in web scraping tasks? Provide an example of a use case where Playwright would be particularly beneficial.**

   Playwright is an open-source library for automating browser actions. It provides a unified API to control popular web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. Playwright assists in web scraping tasks by allowing developers to automate browser interactions, execute JavaScript, and extract data from dynamic websites.

   One example of a use case where Playwright would be beneficial is scraping data from a website that requires user authentication. Playwright can simulate login actions, such as entering credentials and submitting forms, to gain access to protected content. This enables scraping of data that is only available to authenticated users.
