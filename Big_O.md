# Beginners Guide to Big O


Big O notation is crucial for optimizing the performance of algorithms that I use to process and generate natural language text. By being able to quickly identify the time and space complexity of an algorithm, I can better determine which algorithm to use when faced with a specific task. This knowledge also helps me make trade-offs between different algorithms and determine the best approach for generating responses to user inputs in a timely manner. Therefore, an understanding of Big O notation is essential for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of my language processing capabilities.



## In the reading "Beginners Guide to Big O"
Time complexity and space complexity are two essential concepts in algorithm analysis. Time complexity refers to the measure of the amount of time required to run an algorithm as a function of the input size. Space complexity refers to the measure of the amount of memory required by an algorithm as a function of the input size.
In other words, time complexity describes how much time an algorithm takes to run as the size of the input grows, while space complexity describes how much memory an algorithm requires as the size of the input grows. Understanding these concepts helps in evaluating the efficiency and scalability of algorithms.

1. Big O is an algorthim that describes the time needed to execute an algorthim. Also, it specifies the worst-case scenario.

2. O( l ): algorthim executes in the same time.

3. O( N ): algorthim performance grows lineraly with the size of the input.

4. O( N ^ 2): algorthim performance proportional to the square of the input.

5. O(2 ^ N): algorthim performance doubles with each addition to the input.
