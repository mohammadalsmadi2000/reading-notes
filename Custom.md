## Django Custom User

**Why does this topic matter?**
Studying Django Custom User Models is important in the context of web development using Django. The default User model provided by Django may not always meet the specific requirements of a project. In such cases, creating a custom User model allows developers to tailor the user authentication system according to their needs. Understanding the benefits, implementation process, and related concepts is crucial for building secure and scalable web applications.

**What are the key benefits of using a Django Custom User Model, and how does it differ from the default Django User Model?**
The key benefits of using a Django Custom User Model include:

1. Flexibility: With a custom User model, you can define additional fields and behaviors specific to your application's requirements. This allows you to store and manage user-related information in a way that aligns with your project's needs.

2. Scalability: By creating a custom User model, you can design the authentication system to scale with your application's growth. You have control over the fields and relationships, enabling you to optimize the database schema and query performance.

3. Consistency: A custom User model ensures a consistent user experience throughout the application. You can define default values, validation rules, and methods relevant to user authentication and management.

4. Security: By customizing the User model, you can enforce specific security measures such as password complexity rules, two-factor authentication, or integration with external authentication providers.

The default Django User model, on the other hand, provides a basic set of fields and functionalities suitable for most projects. It includes common attributes like username, password, email, and permissions. However, it may lack certain features or fields needed for specialized user management. Custom User models allow developers to extend and enhance the default functionality to meet their project's unique requirements.

**Explain the process of creating and implementing a Custom User Model in Django, including the necessary changes to settings.py and the required model fields.**
To create and implement a Custom User Model in Django, you would generally follow these steps:

1. Create a new Django app: Start by creating a new app within your Django project. This app will contain the code for your custom User model.

2. Define the custom User model: In the models.py file of your app, define the custom User model by subclassing the `AbstractBaseUser` or `AbstractUser` provided by Django. Customize the fields and behaviors of the model based on your project's requirements. For example, you can add fields like `first_name`, `last_name`, or additional authentication-related fields.

3. Create a User Manager: Implement a custom User Manager that inherits from `BaseUserManager`. This manager is responsible for creating and managing User instances.

4. Update settings.py: In the settings.py file of your project, specify the custom User model as the default User model by setting the `AUTH_USER_MODEL` variable to the app label and model name. For example, if your app is named "accounts" and the custom User model is named "CustomUser," you would set `AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'accounts.CustomUser'`.

5. Make and apply migrations: Create the necessary database migrations for the new User model using Django's migration commands (`makemigrations` and `migrate`).

6. Update references: Search for any references to the old User model in your project and update them to use the new custom User model. This includes areas such as authentication views, forms, and templates.

By following these steps, you can create and implement a custom User model in Django, replacing the default User model with your customized version.

**What is DjangoX and how does it complement or extend the functionality of Django? Provide an example use case for incorporating DjangoX in a project.**
DjangoX is not a widely known library or framework associated with Django. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, there is no official DjangoX package. Therefore, I cannot provide an example use case or elaborate on its complementarity or extension to Django functionality.

## Things I want to know more about
- If DjangoX has emerged as a new package or framework since my knowledge cutoff date and what it offers in terms of functionality.
- If there are any alternative libraries or frameworks that complement or extend Django's functionality.
