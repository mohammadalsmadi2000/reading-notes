# Linked List Implementation
Linked lists are a data structure used to store a collection of elements. Each element, or node, in a linked list contains a value and a reference, or pointer, to the next node in the list. This structure allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements, as well as dynamic sizing of the list.

One way to visualize a linked list is to think of it like a chain of interconnected nodes. Each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the chain, creating a sequence of nodes that can be traversed to access each element.

Linked lists come in several different types, including singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists. Singly linked lists only have a reference to the next node, while doubly linked lists have references to both the next and previous nodes. Circular linked lists connect the last node in the list back to the first node, creating a loop.

When implementing linked lists, it's important to consider the time complexity of the operations. The time complexity of accessing an element in a linked list is O(n), since we may have to traverse through n nodes to find the desired element. However, inserting and deleting elements can be done in O(1) time, since we only need to update a few pointers.

In summary, linked lists are a useful data structure for storing collections of elements that require dynamic sizing and efficient insertion and deletion. When implementing linked lists, it's important to consider the type of linked list needed and the time complexity of the operations.
